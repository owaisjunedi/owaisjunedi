### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Owais Junedi**](https://linkedin.com/in/owais-junedi/), a software engineer based in Hyderabad, India.

I currently work as a software engineer at [**@Innovacx**](https://innovacx.com/) & I'm also contracted to [**@Avery Dennison**](https://github.com/averydennison), where I help build & manage several of their eCommerce applications. Previously, I was at [**@Doyen Solutions**](https://doyensolutions.com/).

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products and have worked on industry-leading services that have 100M+ users. I have contributed to major feature launches and automating systems in customer-facing consoles with high traffic.

I grew up in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia & love Shawarma. 

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the developments of science, volunteering in my community, trying to read some books, and binge-watch tv series.
